## Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE

![Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE](big_screenshot.png?raw=true "Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE")

Fred lives on planet Figadore in the Hercules cluster, he likes watching cat videos from planet Earth via _Parallax Shift_, but the network link has gone **OFFLINE**!

Help Fred by unlocking doors, solving puzzles and collecting cubes to pay for the entanglement repolarisation required to get his planet back online.
